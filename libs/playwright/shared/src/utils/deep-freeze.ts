 * If an object or property is already frozen, it will not be recursed into. This is mostly to prevent loops in the case of
 * circular references but may cause incomplete application if a shallow `Object.freeze()` call was made beforehand.
 *
 * All own properties that are data properties are frozen/recursed into (incl. symbol-keyed and non-enumerable ones).
 * Accessor properties (i.e., ones with getters/setters) and prototypical properties are skipped.

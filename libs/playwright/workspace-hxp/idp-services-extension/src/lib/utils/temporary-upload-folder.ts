/**
 * Provides a simple way to temporarily upload local files to HxPR.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Use {@linkcode TemporaryUploadFolder.create()} to create a `SysFolder` and class instance.
 * - Use {@linkcode uploadFile()} or {@linkcode uploadFiles()} to upload local files to the `SysFolder`.
 * - Call the [async dispose method][1] (e.g., via `await using`) to recursively delete the `SysFolder` and its contents.
 *
 * [1]: <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-2/#using-declarations-and-explicit-resource-management>
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * await using uploadStore = await TemporaryUploadFolder.create(hxprApi);
 * const [doc1, doc2] = await uploadStore.uploadFiles([file1, file2]);
 * // ... use uploaded files in tests ...
 * ```
